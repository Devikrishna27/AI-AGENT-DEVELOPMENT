Implementation of an AI agent using a pre-trained Large Language Model API to enable real-time user interaction and intelligent response generation.





# Productivity AI Agent

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python-based Productivity AI Agent. The agent interacts with users through text input and provides productivity-related assistance such as study plans, to-do lists, and motivational messages. The project demonstrates the basic working of an AI agent using rule-based logic.

## Features
- Interactive command-line AI agent
- Generates simple study plans
- Helps create to-do lists
- Provides motivational quotes
- Continuous interaction until user exits

## How the AI Agent Works
The AI agent uses:
- A predefined list of motivational quotes
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- A loop to continuously interact with the user

Based on keywords in the user’s input (such as *study plan*, *to-do*, or *motivate*), the agent generates an appropriate response.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Kaggle Notebook / Jupyter Notebook



## How to Run
1. Open the notebook or Python file in Kaggle or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all code cells
3. Interact with the agent by typing commands
4. Type `exit` to stop the program

## Example Commands
- `study plan`
- `to-do`
- `motivate`
- `exit`

## Sample Output

Agent: Hi! I am your productivity assistant. Agent: Here is a quick study plan:

45 min study

10 min break

Repeat for 3 cycles


## Limitations
- This agent does not use machine learning or LLMs
- Responses are predefined and keyword-based
- Limited understanding of complex user input

## Future Improvements
- Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Add personalized study schedules
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
